# Dinner Booking App

This is a basic HTML and Javascript-based form application that allows users to book a dinner reservation in which users enter their name, phone number, time of dining, meal items, etc. The form allows for some client-side validation for users' information entering and generates dynamic cases for feedback to include whether the form is completing overall successfully.
